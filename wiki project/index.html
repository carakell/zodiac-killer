<h2> "I like killing because it's so much fun" </h2>

<h4>The Zodiac Killer is the pseudonym of an unidentified serial killer <br> who operated in Northern California from at least the late 1960s to the early 1970s. <br>
  <p> The name <i>"Zodiac"</i> was originated in a series of <br> taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press. <br>
  <p> These letters included four ciphers. Only one has been definitively solved.
<p>
<br><i>The killer's identity remains unknown.</i></h4>
